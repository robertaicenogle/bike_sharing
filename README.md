## Summary
Based on the data, high activity of the bike sharing service occurs during August 2019 in New York City, primarily on Manhattan Island, by male users in the morning and during evening rush hour. Citi Bike services, consequently, are a viable alternative to public transportation by commuting workers. This analysis could be benefitted by additional analysis comparing data for other months to assess trends across the year. Another potential addition is the inclusion of weather data to assess the correlation between the weather and ridesharing.
